# Four Card Feature Section

## Description

This is a newbie Frontend Mentor challenge that focuses on layout. In this case the desktop version provided a great opportunity to use the grid area property. Furthermore, there is also dark-mode toggle functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses SCSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for functionality. To compile the SCSS into CSS, you'll need a SCSS compiler. There are many available, including command line tools and plugins for text editors and IDEs.

You'll also need a modern web browser to open the HTML file and run the JavaScript code.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a zip.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you're using a command line SCSS compiler, run the appropriate command to compile the SCSS into CSS. If you're using a plugin for your text editor or IDE, follow the instructions provided with the plugin.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
